# MDS-of-DGG
An attempt to reproduce the multidimensional scaling (MDS) of Jaccard coefficients among rows of DGG matrix as found page 7, figure 4 in the [2-Mode concepts in social network analysis publication](http://www.steveborgatti.com/research/publications/2modeconcepts.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1) publication of Stephen P. Borgatti using Python using Python libraries and IPython Notebook. [The notebook is available here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/JBPressac/MDS-of-DGG/blob/master/Davis%20Southern%20Women%20MDS%20of%20Jaccard%20coefficient.ipynb).
